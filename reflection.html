                  <p>Responsive design is a web development approach that creates changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the size 
                     and orientation of the device being used to view it. So, how do we use responsive design when creating different websites?
                     Everyone nowadays wants to have a different kind of website from the other, that is when we can use Responsive design.
                     The responsive web design makes sure that the website automatically switches to accommodate for resolution, image size, 
                     and scripting abilities when the user switches from one device to another. 
                     All the websites must have web technologies that can respond automatically to the user's preferences. Responsive design gives an advantage to the web pages as it
                     makes them look good on all devices. Other advantages are faster pages, lower maintenance needs, lower costs, higher
                     conversion rates, and many other benefits. So, when building web apps for different devices we should, of course, make 
                     the use of responsive design as it has many perks but we should also understand that it is a tool, not a cure-all.
                     We should also focus on the details of content, design, and performance to support users across all devices. So,
                     we need to be careful when creating web apps for different devices, we need to make sure they all look correct when used 
                     in different devices. Well, in this course I have learned how to make different websites using JavaScript, HTML5, 
                     CSS, and DOM. It was a really nice experience, the materials were good and the professors too,it was really easy
                     to understand despite the course being online.  
                     This course has been beneficial in so many ways because we all use the internet in todayâ€™s life for different uses, be it
                      finding a way through a new city, connecting to your loved ones across the country,videoconferencing or as a 
                      source of entertainment. So, behind all these is a web developer who makes sure that the website is both functional and 
                      aesthetically pleasing. I'm glad to be one of the developers who can make their website now.
